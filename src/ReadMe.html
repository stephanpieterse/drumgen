				<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><B><U><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">GETTING
				STARTED</FONT></U></B> <BR></FONT><B>INSTALLATION:</B> <BR>The
				program does not have an installation program! Simply copy the
				main executable (GenP.exe) into the directory of your choice, and
				start using it! <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>USING THE PROGRAM:</B> <BR>The main screen consists of The
				Rhythm Chart. There are four lines in the Rhythm Chart, labelled
				Right Hand, Left Hand, Right Foot and Left Foot respectively. For
				each of these, you can create a unique pattern. The pattern
				creation is split into various sections. Firstly, the rhythm
				pattern, then the accent pattern, then the note values, then the
				subdivisions. You can choose each of these yourself, or let the
				program generate random ones for you. You can also select the
				amount of bars the exercise should be generated for, and the
				count to be used. These settings can be changed in the small
				panel above the Rhythm Chart. To access the pattern options,
				middle click on the lane you wish to change. You can enter a
				rhythm or accent pattern in the specified boxes, or let the
				program generate random ones for you. A pattern consists of 2
				characters: 'x' indicating a note, '-' indicating a rest. All
				rhythm patterns are constructed using these characters. Accent
				patterns are constructed using 'X' to indicate an accent, and 'x'
				or '-' to indicate normal note volume. A row of buttons presents
				the different note values that can be used for the specific limb
				(Whole, Half, Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth and Thirty-Second
				Notes). Selecting the &ldquo;Mute&rdquo; button will disable the
				sound of that specific limb. When the button is depressed and
				gray, it is considered not muted. When the button is pressed and
				coloured yellow, it is considered to be muted. The program works
				with subdivisions in a unique manner. Please see the &ldquo;Complex
				and Inverse Subdivisions Section. If you want to quickly edit a
				pattern, move the mouse over the Rhythm Chart, and a grid will be
				displayed. Right click for options, and left click on a cell to
				perform the selected action. 
				</P>
				<P><BR><B>NOTE:</B> The notation used for this program is NOT
				standard drum notation. Instead, the program uses 4 percussion
				lines, with non-standard note heads. I am certainly sorry for any
				inconvenience, but I believe this system is better, as individual
				limb patterns can be created without necessarily being restricted
				to a certain voicing. Also, various subdivisions can be used,
				creating the ultimate independence exercise! <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>COMPLEX AND INVERSE SUBIDIVISIONS</B></P>
				<P>The idea is from a method I designed. Instead of playing a
				subdivision only between 2 notes, why don't we generalise it a
				bit? Why not have 4 notes in the space of 3? This is now
				possible. The &ldquo;Subdivisions&rdquo; box lets you specify the
				amount of notes you want (up to 9) and the amount of notes you
				want them to be spaced in, which can be specified in the
				&ldquo;Subdivision Note Spacing&rdquo; box. To turn off complex
				subdivisions, deselect the &ldquo;Enable Complex Subdivisions&rdquo;
				check box in the &ldquo;General Options&rdquo; window. If you
				just want to use basic subdivisions, remember to set the
				&ldquo;Subdivision Note Spacing&rdquo; to 2.</P>
				<P><BR><BR>

				<P><B>DEVICE CONTROLS</B> <BR><IMG SRC="Screenshots/devcntrl.jpeg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=81 BORDER=0><BR>The
				device controls can be viewed/hidden by selecting the &ldquo;Device
				Controls&rdquo; option in the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; menu. This
				form contains the MIDI controls. From here you can play, stop or
				pause the MIDI playback. When these buttons are inaccessible they
				appear flat and greyed out. Next to these buttons is a box
				containing an up and a down arrow, and a number. This is the
				tempo to play the exercise at, and can be used to quickly change
				the tempo. Next to this is a button with a small metronome image.
				In the top right corner will appear either a red circle or a
				green checkmark. This is to indicate whether or not the metronome
				sound is on or off.<BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>THE KIT VOICING FORM</B> <BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/KITDES~1.JPE" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=654 BORDER=0><BR>To
				access the kit voicing options, select &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; and
				then &ldquo;Voicing / kit Designer&rdquo; from the main menu.
				Alternatively, you can click on the crossed drumsticks icon on
				the toolbar. On the voicing form, there are two images. At the
				top, the larger rectangle, is used to hold voicing data for the
				hand patterns. At the bottom, the smaller rectangle is used to
				hold voicing data for the feet patterns. Click on one of the
				radio-buttons representing the limbs in order to start drawing a
				voicing pattern. To get a visual representation of what you are
				playing, you might want to draw a version of your own drumkit on
				the canvases. Click on the &quot;Design Mode&quot; button to
				activate design mode. The Design Options will now become
				available to you. You can select which shape to draw, how thick
				its lines are, and what colour the lines should be. You can also
				assign certain areas to a specific sound (Multiple Voicings per
				limb need to active to do this. If this is not activated, a
				standard template will be used which cannot be edited). If you
				want to save a voicing pattern, select &quot;Save&quot; for
				either the hands or the feet. Go to the directory in which you
				wish to save the files, type in the desired name, and then press
				save. If you want to load a voicing pattern, select the &quot;Load&quot;
				option for either hands or feet, locate the Voicing data file and
				click load. <BR><BR><B>THE PLAY ALONG FORM<BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/PLAYAL~1.JPE" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=461 BORDER=0><BR></B>This
				form displays the kit with the voicings created in the Kit
				Designer. To access it, select &ldquo;Play Along Kit&rdquo; from
				the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu. The colour for normal and accented
				notes can be chosen from the colour boxes at the top of the form.
				When the exercise is played while this form is open, the
				appropriate parts of the kit will light up to indicate that the
				current note is being played there.<BR><BR><BR>

				<P><B>STICKING PATTERNS</B> <BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/STICKI~1.JPE" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=652 HEIGHT=196 BORDER=0><BR>To
				access this feature, select &ldquo;Sticking Patterns&rdquo; from
				the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu. Press the &ldquo;Generate&rdquo;
				button to generate a random sticking pattern. This pattern can be
				inverted (Right changed to left and vice versa) or reversed
				(First note last, etc.) by pressing the appropriate button. The
				resultant pattern can be used as a standalone exercise, or it can
				be applied to any two of the four limbs by simply selecting which
				limbs you want to apply the pattern to from the appropriate
				groups of options, and the pressing the &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;
				button. The pattern can also be saved to the Pattern Repository
				by clicking the &ldquo;Add to Pattern Repository button. <BR><BR><BR>

				<P><B>RHYTHM TRAINER</B> <BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/RHYTHM~1.JPE" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=911 HEIGHT=570 BORDER=0><BR>To
				access this feature, select &ldquo;Rhythm Trainer&rdquo; from the
				&ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu. This feature allows you to make your
				own speed and time exercises. Select, in the &ldquo;New Item&rdquo;
				group, the settings for which you would like the metronome to
				pulse. Then press the &ldquo;Add Item&rdquo; button. Up to 255
				different settings can be entered. All the items will be
				displayed in the grid on the left-hand side of the screen. The
				Custom Pulse feature uses the same characters as the Metronome's.
				'X' for an accented note, 'x' for an unaccented note, and '-' for
				no note. Options regarding the exercise include: Repeat. Once the
				exercise has been played through, the timer will start at the
				beginning again if this box is checked. Loop Front to Back. If
				this box is checked, the exercise will be played through, and
				then played backwards. <BR>If you have a device capable of MIDI
				Input, you can also play along to the exercise to check your
				progress. Check the &ldquo;Pad Active&rdquo; Box. A small text
				pop-up will display how accurately you are playing to the
				click.<BR>If you want to use the pad to play an exercise, check
				the &ldquo;Check Voicing&rdquo; box. Load a pattern from the
				sticking patterns form or from the pattern repository. You can
				select the voicings to be regarded as &ldquo;correct&rdquo; for
				the 2 limbs. When the exercise is playing, a small text pop-up
				will inform you if the voicing you are playing is right or
				wrong.<BR><BR><BR>

				<P><B>PATTERN REPOSITORY</B> <BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/PATREP~1.JPE" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=370 HEIGHT=570 BORDER=0><BR>The
				Pattern Repository appears on the right hand side of the screen.
				Here, patterns that have been generated can be stored. This is
				useful for generating random exercises, and then replacing single
				patterns with those stored in the repository. Patterns are
				automatically added to the repository if randomly generated (to
				turn off this feature, uncheck &ldquo;Automatically Add Patterns
				to the Pattern Repository&rdquo; in the General Options window).
				Patterns can be deleted or applied by right-clicking the
				appropriate pattern in the repository. To save or open a set of
				Pattern Repository patterns, select the appropriate option from
				the &ldquo;File&rdquo; Menu. <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>SAVING AND LOADING PATTERNS</B> <BR>To save or load
				patterns, select &ldquo;File&rdquo; from the main menu and select
				the appropriate option. <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>MIDI DRUMS</B> <BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/MIDI~1.JPE" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=585 HEIGHT=534 BORDER=0><BR>To
				access the MIDI options, select &ldquo;Options&rdquo; and then
				&ldquo;MIDI Options&rdquo; from the main menu. Here, you can
				select normal and accented note volumes and select the sounds
				that should be played. There are two modes in which the drums can
				function, Single Voicing and Multi Voicing Mode. In Single
				Voicing Mode, each limb plays only one sound. The notes for all
				the limbs are represented using the same standard symbol. In
				Multi Voicing Mode, each limb can play a variety of sounds (up to
				10 different sounds) and each sound is represented by a different
				symbol. Each sound also has a unique letter (Standard letter is
				x). A '?' means that that specific symbol will not be used. When
				in Multi Voicing Mode, you can use the characters specified to
				create patterns on the Rhythm Chart. These characters should be
				entered into the appropriate boxes (excluding accent patterns) or
				via the right click menu of the Rhythm Chart. You can also select
				the device that should be used for MIDI output and/or input. A
				message will be displayed upon start-up and on refreshing the
				device lists if MIDI input and/or output devices have not been
				found. <BR><B>NOTE:</B> If at least one device has not been found
				for either MIDI input or output, features using them will be
				deactivated. <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>THE METRONOME</B> <BR><IMG SRC="SCREEN~1/METRO~1.JPE" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=345 HEIGHT=577 BORDER=0><BR>To
				access the metronome form, select &quot;Options&quot; and then
				&quot;Metronome Options&quot; from the main menu. Here, you can
				set the tempo for the metronome (which is also the tempo for the
				MIDI drums), the note values, and the subdivision value for the
				metronome pulse. Whether or not the metronome should play and/or
				show the current position on the grid can be changed using the
				appropriate check boxes. <BR>The volume for the metronome can be
				changed at the bottom of the form. <BR>You can also enter your
				own pulse pattern, by checking the &quot;Custom Pulse Pattern:&quot;
				box, and then entering your own pattern. Pulse patterns should be
				entered as follows : 'X' indicates an accented note. 'x'
				indicates a normal note. '-' indicates a rest, or no note. Pulse
				patterns can be of any length up to 255 characters. <BR>The
				sliding bar that keeps track of where you are on the rhythm chart
				pulses along with the metronome, and also shows subdivisions the
				metronome might be playing. Note that the slider can only be set
				to start on a pulse of the metronome e.g if the metronome is set
				to quarter note triplets, you cannot start the exercise on an
				eighth note. <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>HISTORY</B> <BR>This gives the user the ability to save
				various patterns temporarily within the program. Patterns are
				automatically saved and loaded as the user uses the program. The
				stored patterns (Maximum of 10) can be accessed by using the
				arrows above the Rhythm Chart. To clear the history, click on the
				&quot;Clear History&quot; button which appears on the bottom of
				the window alongside all the other clear functions. To add a
				comment to a pattern, click the &ldquo;Comment&rdquo; button next
				to the current pattern number. This will display a form with the
				current comments, if any. Comments may be up to 255 characters
				long. When a pattern is loaded and a comment is present, by
				default, the window will be displayed with the comment. To turn
				of this feature, deselect &ldquo;Display Pattern Comments&rdquo;
				from the General Options menu. <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>PATTERN FEATURES</B> <BR>To invert or reverse patterns,
				click on the &quot;Functions&quot; menu option and select the
				option of your choice. Alternatively, you can right click on the
				appropriate pattern in the Pattern Options section, and a pop-up
				menu will display the available options. <BR><BR><BR>
				</P>
				<P><B>ACCENT OPTIONS</B> <BR>These options are available from the
				General Options Menu. When 'Shift' is selected, the Accent
				pattern is applied over a new Rhythm pattern as usual. When
				'Adapt&quot; is selected, and notes are deleted / added, the
				Accent pattern is adapted so that the all the notes that
				previously had accents still do, and new notes do not.

				TIPS</FONT></FONT></U></B> <BR>Although this program can be used
				for independence, accuracy and time training, the help of a good
				teacher is still invaluable. This program does not teach
				techniques, and to a great extent does not teach proper
				sight-reading. It is also essential to play with and learn from
				other musicians, not just drummers. You may have all the drum
				playing speed and skill in the world, but if you cannot work and
				play with other musicians, your chances of being in a gigging
				(and hopefully paying) band decrease exponentially. When
				practising sticking patterns, remember, your feet are just as
				important as your hands! Try doing the sticking pattern with your
				feet. Once you have accomplished that, try the sticking pattern
				between, say, your left foot and your left hand. Always try new
				things, rudiments can be a great tool, they don't have to become
				boring! Invest in some material to help you learn sight-reading.
				This may not seem as valuable to you if your not in a situation
				where reading and learning material quickly is essential, but
				learning to sight-read will greatly increase the amount of
				resources available to you to learn from, and understanding at
				least a small part of theory will make you a better musician as
				well. Remember to try your own ideas as well, or develop some of
				the patterns form the program in your own ways. This program
				provides many features that can be of great use, but it's still
				your creativity at the end of the day that will make these
				exercises your own.

				<BR></FONT>God, for some talent with programming and
				understanding and patience, and lets not forget giving me a drum
				kit! For everyone who is a friend who put up with my rantings
				about the program (Michael en Wilmie) My dad, for supplying me
				with a computer and some basic programming knowledge a long time
				ago. About.com, whose articles have been invaluable in my
				attempts to a better program. Michael Bester again for doing most
				of the testing. And you, for using my program! I hope this
				program inspires you to be a better technical drummer!
