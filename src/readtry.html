	</P>
	<P><A NAME="Install"></A><FONT COLOR="#800000"><BR></FONT><B>INSTALLATION:</B>
	<BR>The program does not have an installation program! Simply copy
	the main executable (GenP.exe) into the directory of your choice,
	and start using it! <BR><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="Using"></A><B>USING THE PROGRAM:</B> <BR>The main screen
	consists of The Rhythm Chart. There are four lines in the Rhythm
	Chart, labelled Right Hand, Left Hand, Right Foot and Left Foot
	respectively. For each of these, you can create a unique pattern.
	The pattern creation is split into various sections. Firstly, the
	rhythm pattern, then the accent pattern, then the note values, then
	the subdivisions. You can choose each of these yourself, or let the
	program generate random ones for you. You can also select the amount
	of bars the exercise should be generated for, and the count to be
	used. These settings can be changed in the small panel above the
	Rhythm Chart. To access the pattern options, middle click on the
	lane you wish to change. You can enter a rhythm or accent pattern in
	the specified boxes, or let the program generate random ones for
	you. A pattern consists of 2 characters: 'x' indicating a note, '-'
	indicating a rest. All rhythm patterns are constructed using these
	characters. Accent patterns are constructed using 'X' to indicate an
	accent, and 'x' or '-' to indicate normal note volume. A row of
	buttons presents the different note values that can be used for the
	specific limb (Whole, Half, Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth and
	Thirty-Second Notes). Selecting the &ldquo;Mute&rdquo; button will
	disable the sound of that specific limb. When the button is
	depressed and grey, it is considered not muted. When the button is
	pressed and coloured yellow, it is considered to be muted. The
	program works with subdivisions in a unique manner. Please see the
	&ldquo;Complex and Inverse Subdivisions Section. If you want to
	quickly edit a pattern, move the mouse over the Rhythm Chart, and a
	grid will be displayed. Right click for options, and left click on a
	cell to perform the selected action. 
	</P>
	<P><BR><B>NOTE:</B> The notation used for this program is NOT
	standard drum notation. Instead, the program uses 4 percussion
	lines, with non-standard note heads. I am certainly sorry for any
	inconvenience, but I believe this system is better, as individual
	limb patterns can be created without necessarily being restricted to
	a certain voicing. Also, various subdivisions can be used, creating
	the ultimate independence exercise! <BR><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="ComplexSubDiv"></A><B>COMPLEX AND INVERSE SUBDIVISIONS</B></P>
	<P>The idea of complex or inverse subdivisions is from a small
	mathematical arrangement of standard subdivisions which I simply
	applied in another context. Instead of playing a subdivision only
	between 2 notes, why don't we generalise it a bit? Why not have 4
	notes in the space of 3? This is now possible to display as well as
	hear how it fits in with the normal pulse. The &ldquo;Subdivisions&rdquo;
	box lets you specify the amount of notes you want (up to 9) and the
	amount of notes you want them to be spaced in, which can be
	specified in the &ldquo;Subdivision Note Spacing&rdquo; box. To turn
	off complex and inverse subdivisions, deselect the &ldquo;Enable
	Complex Subdivisions&rdquo; check box in the &ldquo;General Options&rdquo;
	window. If you just want to use basic subdivisions, remember to set
	the &ldquo;Subdivision Note Spacing&rdquo; to 2.</P>
	<P><B>Quick Definition:</B><BR><U>Inverse Subdivisions:</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
	</SPAN>An inverse subdivision is a reversal of a normal subdivision.
	For instance, a triplet now becomes 2 notes in the space of 3.
	Playing this will generate a feel exactly like that of the triplet,
	but putting it in the correct context with music and / or a steady
	pulse will make the inverse feel apparent, as both your mind and
	your body may recognize it, but because you are thinking of it
	differently, you may be inclined to feel you are playing it
	incorrectly (even when you may be playing it perfectly.)</P>
	<P><BR><U>Complex Subdivisions:</U> A complex subdivision is a
	non-standard, non-inverted subdivision. 5 notes per 7, or 3 per 5,
	are both complex subdivisions. There is no standard form of these
	subdivisions. Being able to play these perfectly along with all
	their pattern permutations should take a long time, so do not be
	discouraged. The best way I can recommend learning these is to take
	a steady pulse. Play either the subdivision or the spread (the
	number of notes the subdivision spans) and play a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
	subdivion of that over the pulse. Then, practice doing that WITHOUT
	thinking of it, but make sure you do it correctly. When your first
	limb is on &ldquo;Auto-Pilot&rdquo;, so to speak, the second limb
	should start doing the second subdivion. Note that this will be a
	subdivion over the standard pulse, which will generate the correct
	feel of the complex subdivion. Now, the really hard part, is taking
	the spread and regarding that as the pulse. Remember, a complex
	subdivion is NOT 2 different standard subdivions at the same time.
	One of the subdivions IS the pulse, and when playing with music,
	this will usually create an incredibly odd feel.</P>
	<P><BR><B><U>Note:</U></B> Although neither of these advanced
	subdivion forms can always be of great use in a musical context,
	your understanding of rhythms and your independence will greatly
	increase, and if used correctly, will create a killer, unmatched
	solo!</P>

	this program can be used for independence, accuracy and time
	training, the help of a good teacher is still invaluable. This
	program does not teach techniques, and to a great extent does not
	teach proper sight-reading. It is also essential to play with and
	learn from other musicians, not just drummers. You may have all the
	drum playing speed and skill in the world, but if you cannot work
	and play with other musicians, your chances of being in a gigging
	(and hopefully paying) band decrease exponentially. When practising
	sticking patterns, remember, your feet are just as important as your
	hands! Try doing the sticking pattern with your feet. Once you have
	accomplished that, try the sticking pattern between, say, your left
	foot and your left hand. Always try new things, rudiments can be a
	great tool, they don't have to become boring! Invest in some
	material to help you learn sight-reading. This may not seem as
	valuable to you if your not in a situation where reading and
	learning material quickly is essential, but learning to sight-read
	will greatly increase the amount of resources available to you to
	learn from, and understanding at least a small part of theory will
	make you a better musician as well. Remember to try your own ideas
	as well, or develop some of the patterns form the program in your
	own ways. This program provides many features that can be of great
	use, but it's still your creativity at the end of the day that will
	make these exercises your own.

	Related: <BR>This program has been designed to work best at a
	resolution of 1024x768. Although the application will change
	according to your resolution, I cannot guarantee a proportional,
	detailed interface at other resolutions.<BR>Some screens may flicker
	at times. <BR><BR>General: <BR>The Play Along Form images tend to
	destroy themselves at unpredictable times. To resolve this problem
	for the time being, simply reload the play-along form. In some cases
	you may have to restart the program though.</P>
